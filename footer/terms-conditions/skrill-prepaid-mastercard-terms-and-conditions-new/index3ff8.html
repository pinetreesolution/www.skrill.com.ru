It is а copy of your physical Skrill Card and has the same card number, expiry date, and CVC as your physical Skrill Card.</p>
												<p><strong>3. Applying for and activating your Skrill Card</strong></p>
												<p>3.1 To apply for a Skrill Card you must be at least 18 years old and a resident of a country within the Single Euro Payments Area or certain other permitted countries. We will require evidence of your identity and your address if we have not already collected this information in relation to your Skrill Account. We may ask you to provide documentary evidence to prove your identity and your address and we may carry out checks electronically by verifying your details with credit reference agencies or other ID verification service providers. Checks with credit reference agencies will be undertaken for verification purposes only, not for obtaining a credit scoring and by accepting these terms and conditions at the time of application and by your on-going possession and use of your Skrill Card (once it is approved and issued to you), you expressly consent to us making such checks at its discretion.</p>
												<p>3.2 Your Skrill Card is denominated in EUR.</p>
												<p>3.3 We will review your application as soon as possible. It remains in our sole discretion whether we issue a Skrill Card to you. If your application for a Skrill Card is approved, we will instantly make available to you your digital Skrill Card and we will endeavour to send your physical Skrill Card to you within 15 Business Days, however, please be aware that in some instances it can take longer for your physical Skrill Card to arrive. A virtual Skrill Card is issued immediately on approval of your application.</p>
												<p>3.4 If you receive a physical Skrill Card you must sign the signature strip on the back of the Skrill Card as soon as you receive it.</p>
												<p>3.5 Your Skrill Card comes pre-activated. However, if you receive a replacement physical card you need to activate it by visiting our Website or the Skrill app and follow the instructions for the activation process.</p>
												<p>3.6 When you apply for a Skrill Card, you will be required to accept these Terms and Conditions in order for a Skrill Card to be issued to you. By using the Skrill Card you are agreeing to these Terms and Conditions (subject always to section 10 below) on a continuous basis.</p>
												<p><strong>4. Funds available through your Skrill Card</strong></p>
												<p>4.1 Your Skrill Card is a way to access funds on your Skrill Account and does not hold a separate balance.</p>
												<p>4.2 You may not spend or withdraw more funds than you currently hold on your Skrill Account or are allowed by the upload, payment and withdrawal limits (“Transaction Limits”) of your Skrill Account or the Transaction Limits of your Skrill Card, whichever is lower.</p>
												<p>4.3 The Transaction Limits of your Skrill Account depend on a variety of factors such as your country of residence, the verification status of your Skrill Account and other factors used by us to determine such limits from time to time in our sole discretion. Please refer to your Skrill Account settings to view your account Transaction Limits.</p>
												<p>4.4 Transaction Limits are quoted in EUR.</p>
												<p>4.5 If for any reason a transaction you make with your Skrill Card causes the balance on your Skrill Account to go into negative, you must immediately upload funds into your Skrill Account to cover the negative balance. We reserve the right to take additional steps such as demanding and enforcing payments from you in order to make good any negative balance you incur.</p>
												<p><strong>5. Using your Skrill Card</strong></p>
												<p>5.1 Transactions made by you through a merchant terminal must be authorised by you by:</p>
												<ul>
													<li>if using CHIP and PIN, entering your PIN;</li>
													<li>if making payments using the magnetic stripe, by signing the merchant receipt;</li>
													<li>if using Contactless payment (if enabled for your Skrill Card), tapping your Skrill Card against a Contactless-enabled reader; or</li>
													<li>by such other means as we shall tell you from time to time.</li>
												</ul>
												<p>You cannot withdraw your authorisation after you have entered your PIN or signed the merchant receipt or tapped your Skrill Card against the Contactless-enabled reader.</p>
												<p>5.2 Online transactions must be authorised by you by entering your Skrill Card details as requested by the retailer. This usually means providing your Skrill Card number, the name on your Skrill Card, the expiry date of your Skrill Card and in many cases the CVC number printed on the back of or otherwise displayed on your Skrill Card but can include any security procedures that we or the retailer require. You cannot withdraw your authorisation after having completed your transaction.</p>
												<p>5.3 You must always make sure that your available funds cover both the value of your transaction and the applicable fees.</p>
												<p>5.4 After you authorise your transaction, the funds of your Skrill Account available for spending through your Skrill Card will be reduced by the amount of the transaction plus any applicable fees. Please note that the actual debit of the transaction to your Skrill Account balance may take longer to process in accordance with the following paragraph. To check your available funds, please log into your Skrill Account and refer to your “available balance”.</p>
												<p>5.5 If your Skrill Card is denominated in a different currency from your Skrill Account, your transactions will be subject to currency conversions in accordance with section 11.4 below and you will incur an additional currency conversion fee for each transaction. Please refer to Section 11 (Fees) below for more detail.</p>
												<p>5.6 You can view your transaction history by logging into your Skrill Account.</p>
												<p><strong>6. Cancellation and expiry of your Skrill Card and Termination of the Terms and Conditions</strong></p>
												<p>6.1 Your physical Skrill Card together with its digital copy will expire on the expiry date printed on the plastic of the last physical Skrill Card that we issue you or such other date as we may notify to you. For a virtual Skrill Card, the expiry date is shown on the virtual card image displayed within your Skrill Account. You will not be able to use your Skrill Card after it has expired.</p>
												<p>6.2 Shortly before your Skrill Card expires we may provide you with a replacement card or contact you to ask whether you require a replacement card. You must ensure that you have sufficient funds in your Skrill Account to cover your Annual Card Membership Fee prior to using your replacement card. We reserve the right not to reissue your card.</p>
												<p>6.3 For the purpose of these Terms and Conditions, your replacement card will be your Skrill Card once you receive it or upon expiry of your then current Skrill Card, whichever is the later. Please note that a digital card is available only with a newly issued physical Skrill Card and is not available with a replacement Skrill Card.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
												<p>6.4 You may cancel your Skrill Card up to fourteen (14) days after you receive your Skrill Card. This fourteen (14) day period is known as the “Cooling-Off Period”. Please note that if you order a physical Skrill Card the Cooling-Off Period will start on the earlier of: (i) the date we have made the digital copy of your physical Skrill Card available to you in your Skrill Account, or (ii) the date you have received your physical Skrill Card. We will refund the initial charge of the Annual Card Membership Fee if you cancel within the Cooling-Off Period.</p>
												<p>6.5 You may also cancel your Skrill Card at any time after the fourteen (14) day Cooling-Off Period as set out below in section 6.6. However, your Annual Card Membership Fee for the year in which the cancellation occurs will not be refunded.</p>
												<p>6.6 You can cancel your Skrill Card immediately by using the tools available to you in the “Skrill Prepaid Card” section on the Website or by calling the customer helpline on +44 (0) 203 308 2520. You can also cancel your Skrill Card by sending us a message through the “<a href="../../../support/index3ff8.html?uniqueLink=3" target="_blank">Contact Us</a>” section on our Website. However, cancellation via our Website will not take effect immediately and we will not be responsible for any delay of the cancellation as a result.</p>
												<p>6.7 These Terms and Conditions will automatically terminate without notice to you upon:</p>
												<ul>
													<li>cancellation of your Skrill Card; or</li>
													<li>termination of the Skrill Account Terms of Use connected to your Skrill Card.</li>
												</ul>
												<p>6.8 We may terminate these Terms and Conditions for any reason by giving you two (2) months’ notice.</p>
												<p>6.9 Following expiry or cancellation of your Skrill Card or termination of these Terms and Conditions, you will not be able to use your Skrill Card and you must destroy it by cutting through the card chip and the magnetic stripe. You must use all reasonable efforts to dispose of your Skrill Card securely so that no third party can get hold of your Skrill Card number or the security number.</p>
												<p>6.10 Save as set out in Clause 6.4, upon termination of these Terms and Conditions you will not be entitled to a refund of money you have already spent on transactions to which you consented or of any fees for use of the Skrill Card before termination.</p>
												<p>6.11 We may suspend, block or otherwise restrict your Skrill Card at any time and without liability to you if:</p>
												<ul>
													<li>we have reasonable grounds to suspect fraud, misuse or other security breach concerning your Skrill Card;</li>
													<li>you are in breach of these Terms and Conditions or the Terms of Use; or</li>
													<li>we need to do so to comply with the law.</li>
												</ul>
												<p>We will notify you of any suspension, blocking or restriction of your Skrill Card and the reasons for such action in advance or, if this is not possible, immediately after the suspension, blocking or restriction unless this would compromise reasonable security measures or to do so would be unlawful. We will reactivate your Skrill Card or replace it with a new one as soon as practicable after the reasons for the suspension and/or the restriction cease to exist.</p>
												<p><strong>7. Keeping your Skrill Card secure</strong></p>
												<p>7.1 You should treat your Skrill Card like cash and keep it safe at all times. The Skrill Card is personal to you and you must not let anyone else use it.</p>
												<p>7.2 You will receive a PIN for your physical Skrill Card and you must keep your PIN safe. You must keep your PIN secret at all times and must not reveal it to anyone. If you think your PIN has been or may have been revealed to another person or otherwise compromised, you must inform us without undue delay by calling the 24 hour Lost and Stolen Helpline on +44 (0) 203 308 2530.</p>
												<p>7.3 We recommend that you check the balance on your Skrill Account and your transaction history regularly online on our Website. You must report to us any transaction which you do not recognise in accordance with section 8 below.</p>
												<p>7.4 If you suspect that someone else knows your Skrill Account ID Information, or either it or your Skrill Card has been lost, stolen, misappropriated, used without authorisation or otherwise compromised, you must tell us without undue delay by calling us on our 24 hour Lost and Stolen Helpline +44 (0) 203 308 2530 so we can cancel your Skrill Card. You can also report your Skrill Card lost or stolen in the “Skrill Prepaid Card” section on the Website. Any undue delay may result in you being liable for any losses as a result where your failure to notify us is intentional or grossly negligent. If you suspect that your Skrill Card is being used by someone else you should also contact the police and report the incident.</p>
												<p>7.5 We may suspend your Skrill Card or otherwise restrict its functionality on reasonable grounds relating to the security of the Skrill Card or any of their security features or if we reasonably suspect that an unauthorised or fraudulent use of your Skrill Card has occurred or that any of its security features have been compromised.&nbsp; We will notify you of any suspension or restriction and of the reasons for such suspension or restriction in advance or, where we are unable to do so, immediately after the suspension or restriction has been imposed, unless notifying you would be unlawful or compromise our reasonable security interests.&nbsp; We will lift the suspension and/or the restriction as soon as practicable after the reasons for the suspension and/or restriction have ceased to exist.</p>
												<p>7.6 If we think your Skrill Card is at risk of fraud or a security threat, we will use the fastest and most secure way of contacting you using the details you have provided to tell you what you need to do to help deal with that risk.</p>
												<p><strong>8. Your liability and refunds</strong></p>
												<p>8.1 If you think that you have lost any of your Skrill Account ID Information, or they have been stolen, or in the event of an unauthorised transaction, or a transaction which has not been executed or has been incorrectly executed by us, you must let us know without undue delay and in any case no later than 13 months after the debit date, through the “<a href="../../../support/index3ff8.html?uniqueLink=3" target="_blank">Contact Us</a>” section of our Website or by contacting customer services on +44 (0) 203 308 2520.&nbsp; If requested to, you must also write to us within seven days to confirm the loss, theft or possible misuse.</p>
												<p>8.2 We will, as soon as practicable, refund the full amount of any unauthorised transaction including any associated fees and charges provided you notify us of the transaction in accordance with this section 8 unless:</p>
												<ul>
													<li>there is prima facie evidence that you have acted fraudulently or have with intent or gross negligence failed to comply with these Terms and Conditions, in which case we will carry out a prompt investigation to determine whether the transaction was unauthorised or</li>
													<li>the Skrill Card was lost or stolen or you have failed to keep your PIN or Skrill Card details safe from misappropriation, in which case you will be liable for losses up to a maximum of 35 GBP (or equivalent in the currency of your Skrill Account) for each instance of loss, theft or misappropriation.</li>
												</ul>
												<p>8.3 Notwithstanding the above, we and the Card Issuer each reserve the right to investigate any disputed transaction or misuse of your Skrill Card before and after a refund.&nbsp; In order to do so we may need more information and assistance from you and you are required to reasonably co-operate with any investigation by us, the Card Issuer or any law enforcement agency or other competent authority. If an investigation carried out after a refund shows that you have acted fraudulently or have with intent or gross negligence failed to comply with the Terms and Conditions, after giving you reasonable notice we will debit your account with the amount refunded and with any associated charges and fees.</p>
												<p>8.4 You will be liable for all losses, costs and expenses incurred by us or the Card Issuer in respect of an unauthorised payment transaction where you have acted fraudulently or have with intent or gross negligence failed to comply with these Terms and Conditions or if you have failed to notify us within the timescales set out in the first paragraph of this section 8 and will pay us all such losses, costs and expenses as soon as we ask you to.</p>
												<p>8.5 Except where you have acted fraudulently or have with intent or gross negligence failed to comply with these Terms and Conditions, you will not be liable for any losses incurred by us or the Card Issuer in respect of an unauthorised payment transaction arising after you notify us of the transaction in accordance with these Terms and Conditions, where we have failed to provide an appropriate means of notification, where we have failed to apply strong customer authentication when we are supposed to or where the Skrill Card has been used in connection with a distance contract other than an excepted contract.&nbsp; "Distance contract" and "excepted contract" have the meanings given in the Consumer Contracts (information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) regulations 2013.</p>
												<p>8.6 Refunds</p>
												<p>8.6.1 Where we are liable for a non-executed or defectively executed payment transaction, we will without undue delay, restore your account to the state it would have been had the defective transaction not taken place and refund any charges and interest that have arisen as a consequence of the non–execution or defective execution of the payment transaction provided you notify us of the transaction in accordance with section 8.1 above.</p>
												<p>8.6.2 Subject to section 8.6.3, you may be entitled to claim a refund in relation to transactions where:</p>
												<ul>
													<li>the authorisation did not specify the exact amount of the transaction when the authorisation was given and the amount of the transaction exceeded the amount that you could have reasonably expected, taking into account your previous spending pattern, these Terms and Conditions and the circumstances of the transaction, or</li>
													<li>the transaction was not authorised by you under these Terms and Conditions.</li>
												</ul>
												<p>8.6.3 Notwithstanding the provisions of section 8.1, a claim for a refund in the circumstances set out in section 8.6.2 will not be accepted where: (a) you have consented directly to us for the payment transaction to be executed and information on the payment transaction has been made available or provided to you by us or the payee at least four (4) weeks before the date of the transaction; (b) you make the claim more than eight (8) weeks after your Skrill Card has been debited, subject always to the provisions of sections 8.3 and 8.4.</p>
												<p>8.7 We will provide you with a refund under section 8.6.2 or justification for refusing it within ten (10) Business Days of receiving your request for such a refund or if we decide to ask you for further information within ten (10) Business Days of receiving the information. You agree to provide any further information as is reasonably necessary for us to ascertain whether the conditions for the refund are satisfied.</p>
												<p>8.8 If you are not satisfied with any justification we may provide for refusing to refund you, you may complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service at Financial Ombudsman Service, Exchange Tower, London, E14 9SR. Telephone: 0800 023 4567 or 0300 123 9123 and email: complaint.info@financial-ombudsman.org.uk.</p>
												<p><strong>9. Our liability</strong></p>
												<p>9.1 Like other payment cards, we cannot guarantee a retailer will accept your Skrill Card, or that we will authorise any particular transaction. This may be because of a systems problem, something outside our reasonable control, or because we are concerned that your Skrill Card is being misused. Accordingly, to the extent permitted under these Terms and Conditions and the law, we shall not be liable in any event that a retailer refuses to accept your Skrill Card, or if we do not authorise a transaction, or if we cancel or suspend use of your Skrill Card. Unless otherwise required by law, we shall not be liable for any direct or indirect loss or damage you may suffer as a result of your total or partial use or inability to use your Skrill Card, or the use of your Skrill Card by any third party. We will also not be liable for any losses or expenses incurred by you arising from our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. In the event that you do not use your Skrill Card in accordance with these Terms and Conditions or we find that you are using the Skrill Card fraudulently, we reserve the right to charge you for any reasonable costs that we incur in taking action to stop you using this Skrill Card and to recover any monies owed as a result of your activities.</p>
												<p><strong>10. Changes to the Terms and Conditions</strong></p>
												<p>10.1 The up-to-date version of the Skrill Card Terms and Conditions will always be available on our Website. We may change these terms at any time. Any changes will be communicated to you by email. The proposed change shall come into effect two (2) months after the date the change notice is deemed received under section 18.1 of the Terms of Use, unless you have given us notice that you object to the proposed changes before the changes come into effect. Changes that make these Terms and Conditions more favourable to you shall come into effect immediately if so stated in the change notice. Changes to exchange rates shall come into effect immediately without notice and you shall not have the right to object to such a change. If you object to the changes, they will not apply to you. However, any such objection shall constitute a notice by you to cancel your Skrill Card.Your right to cancel your Skrill Card at any time without incurring additional cancellation charges remains unaffected.</p>
												<p>10.2 Changes to the spending limits of your Skrill Card that are necessary in order for us to comply with legal requirements are not considered to be changes of these Terms and Conditions therefore do not require prior notice. You can always check your spending limits by logging into your Skrill Account.</p>
												<p><strong>11. The Fees</strong></p>
												<p>11.1 The fees applicable to your Skrill Card are set out in the Prepaid card subsection of the "Fees" section on the Website.</p>
												<p>11.2 Fees will be deducted from your Skrill Account balance. Fees are quoted in EUR. If your Primary Account Currency is not denominated in EUR then the fees will be converted from EUR into the Primary Account Currency at the Skrill Card Rate applicable at the time and then deducted without charging you a foreign exchange fee..</p>
												<p>When you use your Skrill Card at an ATM, you may also be subject to applicable fees, surcharge rules and regulations of the relevant ATM, or other financial institution or association.</p>
												<p>11.3 Transactions with your Card may be subject to currency conversions. Where you make a transaction that requires one or more currency conversions we may charge you a foreign exchange fee and the amount of the transaction will be converted based on the Card Exchange Rate and/or the Skrill Card Rate as follows:</p>
												<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where your Primary Account Currency is in EUR and you make purchases or withdraw cash with your Skrill Card in a currency different than EUR we will charge you a foreign exchange fee and the amount of the transaction will be converted based on the Card Exchange Rate;</p>
												<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where your Primary Account Currency is different than EUR and you make purchases or withdraw cash with your Skrill Card in your Primary Account Currency we won’t apply a foreign exchange fee but will apply the Skrill Card Rate.</p>
												<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where your Primary Account Currency is different than EUR and you make purchases or withdraw cash with your Skrill Card in a currency that is different to both your Primary Account Currency and your Skrill Card currency we will first convert the amount of the transaction to EUR based on Card Exchange Rate and then we will convert that amount from EUR to your Primary Account Currency based on the Skrill Card Rate applicable at the time. In addition, we will apply a foreign exchange fee on the Transaction so converted; and</p>
												<p>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where your Primary Account Currency is different than EUR and you make purchases or withdraw cash with your Skrill Card in EUR then we will charge you a foreign exchange fee and the amount of the transaction will be converted from EUR to your Primary Account Currency based on the Skrill Card Rate applicable at the time.</p>
												<p>You can find further details on the applicable foreign exchange fee, the Card Exchange Rate, and our mark-up over the latest available foreign exchange reference rates issued by the European Central Bank (ECB) in the “Fees” section of our Website. You will be notified via automatic electronic notification (such as email or push notifications via the Skrill app) with transaction details every time you use your Skrill Card to make a payment. You have the option to unsubscribe from receiving such notifications.</p>
												<p><strong>12. Your details</strong></p>
												<p>You must let us know as soon as possible if you change your name, address, and phone number or email address using the details available in the “<a href="../../../support/index3ff8.html?uniqueLink=3" target="_blank">Contact Us</a>” section of our Website. If we contact you in relation to your Skrill Card, for example, to notify you that we have cancelled your Skrill Card or to send you a refund by cheque, we will use the most recent contact details you have provided to us. Any email to you will be treated as being received as soon as it is sent by us unless within 24 hours we receive a failure notice indicating that the email has not been transmitted. We will not be liable to you if your contact details have changed and you have not told us.</p>
												<p><strong>13. Data protection</strong></p>
												<p>13.1 You explicitly consent to us accessing, processing, and retaining any information you provide to us, for the purposes of processing transactions you make using your Skrill Card.&nbsp; This does not affect our respective rights and obligations under data protection legislation. You may withdraw this consent by cancelling your Skrill Card. If you withdraw consent in this way, we will cease using your data for this purpose, but may continue to process your data for other purposes where we have other lawful grounds to do so, such as where we are legally required to keep records of transactions or you continue to receive other services from Skrill, including the Skrill Account.</p>
												<p>13.2 In applying for the Skrill Card and using it, you agree that we can use your personal information in accordance with our Privacy Policy. Our Privacy Policy is set out on our Website, and includes details of the personal information that we collect, how it will be used, and who we share it with.</p>
												<p>13.3 By using the Skrill Card at retailers or elsewhere to make a payment or withdraw cash, you also consent to the use of your personal information as required to execute the payment in accordance with regulatory requirements and the Mastercard Rules. Depending on where you use your Skrill Card, this may include a processing of your information outside the European Economic Area.</p>
												<p><strong>14. Disputes with retailers</strong></p>
												<p>We accept no responsibility for the goods or services you purchase using your Skrill Card. All such disputes must be addressed directly with the merchant providing the relevant goods or services. Once you have used your Skrill Card to make a purchase, we are unable to stop that transaction. However, where you have used your Skrill Card to buy goods or services you may have a claim against the merchant if the goods or services are unsatisfactory, not supplied, supplied only in part or do not match the supplier’s description. You must notify us of any dispute within 60 days of the purchase and the chargeback will only be applied to your account if successfully secured from the merchant.&nbsp; If you wrongly make a chargeback claim, we will be entitled to charge you any fees we reasonably incur in pursuing the chargeback claim and we will be entitled to debit your Skrill Account with the amount of any such fees.</p>
