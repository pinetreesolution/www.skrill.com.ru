												<p><strong>3.3. Eligible Transactions</strong></p>
												<p>A send money transaction using the Skrill Money Transfer Services will be an Eligible Transaction for the purposes of these Terms and Conditions if:</p>
												<p>(a) the sender and the recipient are in different countries;</p>
												<p>(b)the transaction amount is equal to or exceeds the minimum transfer amount (excluding fees or taxes, where and if applicable);</p>
												<p>(c) the transaction is successfully completed. This minimum transfer amount may change depending on the Referred Member’s chosen wallet currency and a foreign exchange rate may apply. A transaction will not be an Eligible Transaction, and therefore no Referral Credits will be earned, if: (i) you use your own Referral Code in order to initiate transactions between your own accounts; (ii) if the Referred Member’s transaction is cancelled at any time for whatever reason (and is therefore not an Eligible Transaction); and (iii) if the Referred Member makes an attempt to qualify for Referral Credits by sending funds back to you.</p>
												<p>For the avoidance of doubt, please note the following transactions are not Eligible Transactions: (i) Transactions made using the your Skrill Prepaid Mastercard®; (ii) uploads to, and withdrawals from, the Referred Members Skrill Account.</p>
												<p><strong>3.4. Redeeming Referral Credits</strong></p>
												<p>Referral Credits may only be redeemed via your Member Account. Once earned, Referral Credits will appear on the “Refer a Friend” module in “My Account”. Accrued Referral Credits can be redeemed against your next Eligible Transaction: you will receive a one – off credit against the next Eligible Transaction equal to the value of the Referral Credits. Referral Credits must be used within three months from the date on which they are earned, after which they will automatically expire and will no longer be available. Referral Credits cannot be transferred or exchanged for cash. If a transaction initiated by you fails and is not successfully completed, any Referral Credits used for the purpose of that transaction will become available again.</p>
												<p>If for any reason you believe that there is a discrepancy regarding your Referral Credits, please contact us at [<em>e-mail address</em>]. Skrill may require you to submit additional information in order to make a determination regarding your Referral Credits. All decisions regarding your Referral Credits will be final and at Skrill’s sole discretion.</p>
												<p><strong>3.5. Sharing Referral Codes</strong></p>
												<p>You can share a Referral Code: (i) By copying and sending it to prospective Referred Members; (2) Via email in a link or (3) By sharing a link on Approved Media.</p>
												<p>Referral Codes must only be used for personal and non-commercial purposes. Referral Codes must only be published or distributed on Approved Media. Any Referral Code shared on any other media or via other means shall be invalidated. Members are prohibited from “spamming” anyone with referral invitations. This includes bulk emailing, texting or messaging unknown people as well as using automated systems or bots through any channel for the purpose of distributing your referral link. Referrers are strictly prohibited from paying to advertise their referral links. Skrill reserves the right to sanction any such activity in its sole and reasonable discretion.</p>
												<p><strong>3.6. Referred Members</strong></p>
												<p>Referred Members who have signed up using a valid Referral Code or link or have submitted the Referral Code upon successful completion of an Eligible Transaction will also receive Referral Credits in the amounts shown in the table above that can be used immediately with their first Eligible Transaction using the Skrill Money Transfer Services. Referral Codes may not be transferred to another person, exchanged for cash, or combined with other Skrill referral programs or incentives. Referral Codes expire within three months from the date on which you sign up for a Member Account.</p>
												<p><strong>3.7. Multiple Referrals</strong></p>
												<p>If a Referred Member receives the same Referral Code or link from multiple Referrers, only the Referrer who has the right to distribute that Referral Code or link (as determined by Skrill in its sole discretion) shall receive the Referral Credits.</p>
												<p><strong>3.8.&nbsp;General Information</strong></p>
												<p><strong>3.8.1.</strong>&nbsp;Skrill, in its sole discretion, may stop paying Referral Credits in respect of a Referred Member, where Skrill has reasonable grounds to believe the Referred Member concerned:</p>
												<p>(a) had a Member Account (either through their direct relationship with Skrill or through another third-party) at the time of the referral by Referrer; or</p>
												<p>(b) performs or attempts to perform a Prohibited Activity.</p>
												<p>Skrill will inform you of any such suspension in advance, or, if this is not possible, immediately afterwards and give its reasons for the suspension unless to do so would compromise our reasonable security measures or would be unlawful.</p>
												<p><strong>3.8.2.</strong>&nbsp;The Referral Credits will be inclusive of VAT, if applicable, or other applicable sales or service tax. The term “VAT” shall mean Value Added Tax or any equivalent sales tax in any relevant jurisdiction.</p>
												<p><strong>3.8.3.</strong>&nbsp;Skrill shall make Referral Credits reports available to you on the “Refer a Friend” Module on “My Account” in such detail as Skrill determines from time to time.</p>
												<p><strong>3.8.4.</strong>&nbsp;Referral Credits will be granted into the applicable Referrer Member Account. If the applicable Referrer Member Account is closed (whether permanently or temporarily) for any reason, Skrill will be unable to pay the Referral Credits. It is your responsibility to ensure your Referrer Member Account remains active. Skrill shall not be liable to you for any losses or damages incurred due to the your Account being suspended or closed.</p>
												<p><strong>3.8.5.</strong>&nbsp;Referral Credits will not be granted to you, and Skrill shall have the right to revoke any Referral Credits granted to you, for any Referred Member that Skrill reasonably suspects relates to illegal or abusive behaviour, fraudulent activity or Prohibited Activities.</p>
												<p><strong>4.&nbsp;Prohibited Activities</strong></p>
												<p>You shall not perform any of the following activities:</p>

												<p>(c) Open or operate a Merchant Account, without the prior written consent of Skrill.</p>
												<p>(d) Register a Member Account on behalf of another person.</p>
												<p>(e) Allow any third-parties to publish your Referral Link on their websites, social media or other marketing materials;</p>
												<p>(f) Offer incentives or rewards to New Members to encourage them to apply for a Member Account.</p>
												<p>(g) Create or employ any mechanism designed to artificially or automatically generate sign- ups to the Skrill Money Transfer Services.</p>
												<p>(h) Register a Skrill Account using counterfeit, forged, imitated, stolen or otherwise altered identification documents.</p>
												<p>(i) Use or create any material that is sexually explicit, offensive, profane, hateful, threatening, harmful, graphically violent, defamatory, libellous, harassing, or discriminatory (whether based on race, ethnicity, creed, religion, gender, sexual orientation, physical disability.</p>
												<p>(j) disparage or portray Skrill or its Referrers in any way that will have a detrimental impact to their reputation.</p>
												<p>(k) artificially attempt to generate any Referred Members by use of deception or misrepresentation;</p>
												<p>(l) commit, or attempt to commit, fraudulent activity;</p>
												<p>(m) make transactions that have no commercial purpose or are not for the personal benefit of the Skrill Account holder.</p>

												<p>(e) You shall not offer, promote or market the Skrill Money Transfer Refer a Friend Programme or the Skrill Money Transfer Services in countries where Skrill: (a) is prohibited or restricted from offering payment processing services; or (b) informs you not to promote the SMT RaF Programme and/or Skrill Money Transfer Services.</p>
												<p>(f) You shall comply with all Applicable Laws and Regulations, licences and codes of conduct applicable to the promotion and marketing of the Skrill Money Transfer Services and SMT RaF Programme;</p>

Where notice is provided in the Claim Period, Skrill shall use reasonable commercial efforts to investigate and resolve any errors or discrepancies and pay any outstanding Referral Credit to you. If you fail to provide notice to Skrill of a Claim within the Claim Period, you shall be deemed to approve the Referral Credit. After the Claim Period, Skrill shall be under no obligation to investigate any Claims and, to the extent permitted by law, you hereby release and discharge Skrill from any and all liability with respect to paying any outstanding Referral Credit that may otherwise have been payable to you.</p>

												<p><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Consequences of Termination</strong></p>

												<p><strong>8.4.</strong>&nbsp;Any provision of these Terms and Conditions which imposes an obligation after termination or expiration of these Terms and Conditions shall survive the termination or expiration of these Terms and Conditions.</p>

Your continuous participation in the Skrill Money Transfer Refer a Friend Programme after such changes shall be deemed acceptance thereof.</p>
												<p>The 2 months’ notice period shall not apply where we believe, in our reasonable opinion, that the change neither reduces your rights nor increases your obligations. In such instances, the change will become effective immediately without prior notice.</p>
												<p><strong>12.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Notices</strong><br> Notices to you shall be sent to the primary email address registered to your Account.

												<p><strong>13.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Force majeure</strong></p>

												<p><strong>15.3.</strong>&nbsp;The SMT RaF Programme shall not be construed to create any employment relationship, agency relationship or partnership between you and Skrill or any Paysafe group company. You shall have no authority to bind Skrill or enter into any agreement on its behalf and nor shall you be considered to be an agent of Skrill or any Skrill group company in any respect.</p>
												<p><strong>15.4.</strong>&nbsp;If any part of these Terms and Conditions is found by a court of a competent jurisdiction to be invalid, unlawful or unenforceable then such part shall be severed from the remainder of the Terms and Conditions, which shall continue to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
