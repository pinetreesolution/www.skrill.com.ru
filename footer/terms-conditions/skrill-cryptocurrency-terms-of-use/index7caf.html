												<p><strong>PART A: BACKGROUND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
												<p><strong>1. The Cryptocurrency Services</strong></p>
												<p>1.1 The “Cryptocurrency Services” are additional services which permit eligible Skrill Account holders to:</p>
												<p>1.1.1 buy and sell interests in certain Supported Cryptocurrencies using funds held in their Skrill Accounts (“Instant Buy/Sell”),</p>
												<p>1.1.2 withdraw funds from their Skrill Accounts to buy Supported Cryptocurrencies and send those Supported Cryptocurrencies to their nominated Cryptocurrency Wallets (“Withdraw to Crypto”)</p>
												<p>1.2 Please note that – unlike the e-money and payment services which we provide under the Skrill Account Terms of Use – cryptocurrencies are not currently regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”). The Cryptocurrency Services provided to you under these Services Terms of Use is likewise not regulated by the FCA.</p>
												<p>1.3&nbsp;<strong>No Financial Advice</strong>. As part of the Cryptocurrency Services, we may provide information on the price, range, or volatility of the Supported Cryptocurrencies and events that have affected the price of cryptocurrencies generally. Any such information provided is solely for your personal use and you may not redistribute it to any third party. We will not however provide you with any advice in connection with the Cryptocurrency Services therefore any such information (whether provided directly by us or via a Cryptocurrency Exchange) should not be relied upon for any investment decision – any decision to buy or sell an interest in a Supported Cryptocurrency rests with you. If you are unsure about whether a transaction involving cryptocurrencies is suitable for you and your circumstances, you should contact an independent financial adviser.</p>
												<p><strong>2. About Skrill and these Cryptocurrency Services Terms</strong></p>
												<p>2.1 Skrill® is a trading name of Skrill Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales with registration number 4260907. We are authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority under the Electronic Money Regulations 2011 for the issuance of electronic money. We are registered under the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017 (MLRs) to carry out specific cryptoasset activities in the UK since 12 November 2021. Our FCA e-money register number is 900001.</p>
												<p>2.2 This document (the “Cryptocurrency Services Terms of Use”) sets out the terms and conditions governing your use of the Cryptocurrency Services and, together with, any other terms and conditions referred to in this document constitute the entire agreement between you and Skrill (“us”, “we”, “our”) regarding the Cryptocurrency Services.</p>
												<p>2.3 Cryptocurrency Services Terms of Use are divided into four separate parts:</p>
												<p>2.3.1 this Part A sets out some general information on the Cryptocurrency Services and these Cryptocurrency Services Terms of Use;</p>
												<p>2.3.2 Part B sets out the specific terms governing your use of the Instant Buy/Sell service;</p>
												<p>2.3.3 Part C sets out the specific terms governing the Withdraw to Crypto and the Withdraw to Crypto from Supported Merchants service (also referred to as Skrill Crypto Withdraw) ; and</p>
												<p>2.3.4 Part D sets out the terms and conditions governing our relationship with you under this Agreement.</p>
												<p>2.4 You are advised to print or download and keep a copy of these Cryptocurrency Services Terms of Use for future reference. You can always view the current Cryptocurrency Services Terms of Use on our Website.</p>
												<p>2.5 By accessing and using the Cryptocurrency Services, you are agreeing to these Cryptocurrency Services Terms of Use.</p>
												<p>2.6 These Cryptocurrency Services Terms of Use should therefore be read together with your Skrill Account Terms of Use which govern your Skrill Account. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the&nbsp;<a href="../skrillaccounttermsofuse/indexfe6a.html?no_cache=1" target="_blank">Skrill Account Terms of Use</a>&nbsp;and these Cryptocurrency Services Terms of Use, these Cryptocurrency Services Terms of Use shall, to the extent of this conflict or inconsistency, prevail.</p>
												<p><strong>3. Eligibility</strong></p>
												<p>3.1 You may only access the Cryptocurrency Services if:</p>
												<p>3.1.1 you are a Skrill Account holder;</p>
												<p>3.1.2 you have not breached the Skrill Account Terms of Use;</p>
												<p>3.1.3 your Skrill Account has not been locked or suspended by Skrill; and</p>
												<p>3.1.4 you are resident in a Supported Country.</p>
												<p>3.2 If you do not have a Skrill Account, you can register by following the instructions on our Website, as set out in section 4 of the Skrill Account Terms of Use.</p>
												<p>3.3 In certain circumstances, we may ask questions or request additional information from you in order to check/verify your identity so that we can continue to meet our legal obligations.</p>
												<p>3.3.1 We may need to carry out identity checks before or after we have made the Cryptocurrency Services available to you.</p>
												<p>3.3.2 We may require you to provide us with information if we reasonably need it in order to complete our identity checks.</p>
												<p>3.4 By using the Cryptocurrency Services, you confirm that:</p>
												<p>3.4.1 you have read and understand <a href="../skrill-cryptocurrency-risk-statement/index.html" target="_blank">the Cryptocurrency Services Risk Statement</a>; and</p>
												<p>3.4.2 you will not use the Cryptocurrency Services in a manner which is contrary to the general prohibitions regarding your Skrill Account according to the Skrill Account Terms of Use.</p>
												<p><strong>4. Availability of the Cryptocurrency Services</strong></p>
												<p>4.1 We make no guarantee that you will be able to use the Cryptocurrency Services at all times. We will only reflect a Cryptocurrency Transaction in your Skrill Account if we have been able to fulfil the Order with the Cryptocurrency Exchange.</p>
												<p>4.2 We cannot guarantee the value of any Supported Cryptocurrencies at the point you submit your Order Instruction. We will use reasonable efforts to fulfil your Order Instruction at the price offered but in some circumstances the relevant Cryptocurrency Exchange may not allow us to do so (and may not tell us why). If this happens, we will notify you and ask you to re-authorise the Cryptocurrency Buy/Sell Order by submitting a fresh Order Instruction (which may be at a different Buy Price/Sell Price).</p>
												<p>4.3 The underlying protocols of the Supported Cryptocurrencies are subject to sudden changes in operating rules (‘forks’). If a fork occurs within the underlying system, we will liaise with the relevant Cryptocurrency Exchange in order to determine the best approach for Skrill customers in relation to such event. Any decision made on behalf of Skrill customers will be made at Skrill’s sole discretion.</p>
												<p>4.4 The Cryptocurrency Services are provided without warranty of any kind, either express or implied. We do not represent that the Cryptocurrency Services will be available all of the time to meet your needs. We will use reasonable endeavours to provide you with the Cryptocurrency Services as soon as possible but we do not guarantee that access will not be interrupted, or that there will be no delays, failures, errors, omissions or loss of transmitted information.</p>
												<p>4.5 We will however use reasonable endeavours to ensure that the Cryptocurrency Services can normally be accessed by you in accordance with these Cryptocurrency Services Terms of Use.</p>
												<p>4.6 We may suspend use of the Cryptocurrency Services for maintenance and we will make reasonable efforts to give you notice of any such suspensions. Where this isn’t possible, we’ll provide you with notice as soon as possible after the fact.</p>
												<p><strong>PART B – INSTANT BUY/SELL</strong></p>
												<p><strong>5. The Instant&nbsp;Buy/Sell service</strong></p>
												<p>5.1 Our Instant Buy/Sell service enables you to:</p>
												<p>5.1.1 purchase interests in one or more Supported Cryptocurrencies using e-money in your Skrill Account or, in the case of a Crypto to Crypto Transaction, using your Cryptocurrency Account;</p>
												<p>5.1.2 sell your interests in one or more Supported Cryptocurrencies in exchange for e-money or, in the case of a Crypto to Crypto Transaction, in exchange for an interest in another Supported Cryptocurrency;</p>

												<p><strong>6. Changing the Supported Cryptocurrencies</strong></p>

												<p>6.1.1 Once we have provided notice to you, we may immediately cancel any Alert, Limit Order or Recurring Buy Order Instruction in respect of the Removed Cryptocurrency.</p>
												<p>6.1.2 You shall be obliged to sell any interest you have in the Removed Cryptocurrency within 14 days of the notice referred to in subsection 6.1 or such shorter period as is required in the following circumstances:</p>
												<p>6.1.2.1 a Cryptocurrency Exchange withdraws a Supported Cryptocurrency from trading;</p>
												<p>6.1.2.2 where a regulator so specifies; or</p>
												<p>6.1.2.3 as otherwise required to ensure Skrill complies with applicable laws,</p>
												<p>(the “Notice Period”).</p>
												<p>6.1.3 If you have not sold all your interests in the Removed Cryptocurrency before the end of the Notice Period, you authorise us to buy back your interest in the Removed Cryptocurrency at the best available price (as calculated by reference to prices listed on the relevant Cryptocurrency Exchange).

												<p><strong>Note.</strong>&nbsp;Following fulfilment of a Buy Order, a Cryptocurrency Exchange shall hold the Supported Cryptocurrency in a pooled account on an “omnibus” basis. This means that it may be held alongside cryptocurrency belonging to other Cryptocurrency Exchange customers (as well as cryptocurrency belonging to the Cryptocurrency Exchange itself). For more information, please see our&nbsp;<a href="../skrill-cryptocurrency-risk-statement/indexfe6a.html?no_cache=1" target="_blank">Risk Statement</a>.</p>

												<p>10.2.2 create an Alert or a Limit Order Instruction for a Crypto to Crypto Transaction,</p>
												<p>in each case to the extent that the interests in Supported Cryptocurrencies that you wish to buy and sell in the Crypto to Crypto Transaction are a Supported Crypto Pair.</p>
												<p>10.3 Fees for Crypto to Crypto Transactions shall be deducted from your Cryptocurrency Account.</p>
												<p>10.4 When we place an order for a Crypto to Crypto Transaction on your behalf, you will assign to us your interest in the Supported Cryptocurrency that you wish to sell so that we may use this to fund the Buy Price.</p>
												<p><strong>11. Alerts</strong></p>
												<p>11.1 Our Alerts service enables you to request that we notify you when your selected Supported Cryptocurrency has reached a specified Trigger Price.</p>
												<p>11.2 You may create an Alert by inputting your chosen Trigger Price and confirming your request. Once Alert has been set up:</p>
												<p>11.2.1 you will receive a notification when the Trigger Price is reached;</p>
												<p>11.2.2 you may view the status of any Alerts you have set up; and,</p>
												<p>11.2.3 you may vary, deactivate or delete an Alert at any time.</p>
												<p>11.3 For the avoidance of doubt, when the Trigger Price is reached in relation to an Alert, this will not constitute an Order Instruction. You may only submit an Order Instruction as per Section 7 above.</p>

												<p>12.3 We may apply limits to the number or value of Cryptocurrency Transactions or P2P Transfers you are able to undertake (e.g. limiting the amount of the interest in Supported Cryptocurrency you are able to buy or transfer in a single transaction) if we reasonably think it would help to manage any risk in a proportionate way.</p>
												<p>12.4 Any limits as described in subsection 12.3 above will be communicated to you within your Skrill Account while using the Instant Buy/Sell service prior to any proposed transaction being confirmed by you.</p>

												<p><strong>PART D – OUR RELATIONSHIP</strong></p>
												<p><strong>16. Transaction Records</strong></p>

												<p>16.1.1 send you a receipt to the primary email address registered to your Skrill Account, including details about the transaction; and</p>
												<p>16.1.2 display the transaction details in your transaction history, which shall include the date of transaction, the Fees charged and, where applicable, the exchange rate applied).</p>

												<p>16.3 You should check your transaction history regularly and you should report any irregularities or clarify any questions you may have as soon as possible by contacting Customer Service.</p>
												<p><strong>17. Fees</strong></p>
												<p>17.1 The fees we charge for the Cryptocurrency Services (the “Fees”) are set out on the&nbsp;<a href="../../../siteinformation/fees/indexb60b.html?no_cache=1&amp;uniqueLink=0" target="_blank">"Fees" section</a>&nbsp;of our Website. For clarity, the<a href="../../../siteinformation/fees/index19d0.html?no_cache=1&amp;uniqueLink=1" target="_blank">&nbsp;"Fees" section</a>&nbsp;forms part of these Cryptocurrency Services Terms of Use. Fees are subject to change in accordance with section 21 (Changes to these Cryptocurrency Services Terms of Use).</p>
												<p>17.2 Each Cryptocurrency Transaction and P2P Transfer will be subject to a Fee, which we will also display prior to such transaction (as applicable).</p>
												<p>17.3 If your Skrill Account or account with a Supported Merchant is denominated in a currency other than Euro, your Cryptocurrency Transactions will be subject to currency conversions. In this case, we will apply foreign exchange fees.</p>
												<p>17.4 Fees payable by you in relation to Cryptocurrency Transactions will be deducted from your Skrill Account balance or, in the case of a Crypto to Crypto Transaction, your Cryptocurrency Account, and you hereby authorise us to do the same.</p>
												<p>17.5 Fees payable by you in relation to P2P Transfers will be notified to you in advance of the P2P Transfer. Further information is available the&nbsp;<a href="../../../siteinformation/fees/index15c2.html?no_cache=1&amp;uniqueLink=2" target="_blank">"Fees" section</a>&nbsp;of our Website.</p>
												<p>17.6 Fees will be charged when the Cryptocurrency Transaction or P2P Transfer is executed. If your Skrill Account balance or – in the case of P2P Transfers and Crypto to Crypto Transactions – your Cryptocurrency Account is insufficient to cover the Fees, we may refuse to execute the Cryptocurrency Transaction or P2P Transfer. Reversal or chargeback Fees will be deducted when incurred.</p>
												<p>17.7 &nbsp;For Withdraw to Crypto (including from Supported Merchants), in addition to the fees payable to Skrill, we may also charge a network fee (also known as the ‘mining fee’) which will be deducted from your total withdrawal amount. The network fee is not a Skrill fee and is paid to miners in order to facilitate your transaction on the blockchain network. We will calculate the network fee based on current market conditions and will notify you of the amount before you confirm the transaction.</p>
												<p><strong>18. Termination; suspension; refusal</strong></p>
												<p>18.1 You may terminate your access to the Cryptocurrency Services with us at any time by sending us notice in writing.</p>
												<p>18.2 We may terminate your access to the Cryptocurrency Services at any time by giving you notice, which may take effect immediately or on such later date as may be specified in the notice.</p>
												<p>18.3 We may at any time suspend or terminate your use of the Cryptocurrency Services without notice if:</p>
												<p>18.3.1 we are required to take such action by a Cryptocurrency Exchange;</p>
												<p>18.3.2 you breach any condition of these Cryptocurrency Services Terms of Use;</p>
												<p>18.3.3 you violate or we have reason to believe that you are in violation of any law or regulation that is applicable to your use of the Cryptocurrency Services;</p>
												<p>18.3.4 we have reason to believe that you are in any way involved in any fraudulent activity, money laundering, terrorism financing or other criminal activity; or</p>
												<p>18.3.5 it is reasonably necessary for us to do so to prevent you or us contravening any applicable law or regulatory requirement.</p>
												<p>18.4 We may suspend your use of the Cryptocurrency Services at any time:</p>
												<p>18.4.1 for security reasons; or</p>
												<p>18.4.2 if we reasonably suspect the Cryptocurrency Services have been or are being used without your authorisation or fraudulently; and we shall notify you either prior to the suspension or, if prior notification is not possible under the circumstances, promptly after the suspension unless we are prohibited by law to notify you.</p>
												<p>18.5 We may refuse to submit an Order Instruction where:</p>
												<p>18.5.1 we are required by a Cryptocurrency Exchange to do so;</p>
												<p>18.5.2 we are, in our reasonable opinion, required to do so by applicable law, regulation or any court or other authority to which we are subject in any jurisdiction; and</p>
												<p>18.5.3 we have concerns about the security of your Skrill Account or we suspect the Cryptocurrency Services are being used in a fraudulent or unauthorised manner.</p>
												<p>18.6 We will try to give you advance notice of any suspension or refusal. Where advance notice is not possible, we will provide you with notice as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter. Unless we are prevented by law (or unless the relevant Cryptocurrency Exchange does not provide us with details), we will try to provide you with details of the nature of the suspension or refusal, the anticipated duration and anything you have to do to remedy any error or circumstances which have led to the suspension or refusal.</p>
												<p>18.7 Whilst your use of the Cryptocurrency Services is suspended, we may (using our reasonable discretion) sell off all or some of your interests by providing notice to you in certain circumstances, for example:</p>
												<p>18.7.1 if you fail to provide any information we have requested or any warranty/representation you have given us is or becomes, in our opinion, materially inaccurate, incorrect or misleading;</p>
												<p>18.7.2 if you take some action (or refrain from doing something) which places us in breach of our legal or regulatory obligations;</p>
												<p>18.7.3 if you breach these Cryptocurrency Services Terms of Use or those of your Skrill Account; or</p>
												<p>18.7.4 for any other reason which we may specify in our notice to you.</p>
												<p>18.8 If we sell off your interests in Supported Cryptocurrencies, we will buy back the interest(s) at prevailing market rates. If the value of the Supported Cryptocurrency has weakened, this means that you may incur a loss relative to the amount you initially paid. We will credit the sale proceeds (in your preferred currency) to your Skrill Account.</p>
												<p>18.9 On termination, unless prohibited by applicable law or by any court or other order to which we are subject in any jurisdiction, for a period of 14 days following the date of termination:</p>
												<p>18.9.1 you will continue to be able to view the balance of your interest(s) in Supported Cryptocurrencies on your Skrill Account dashboard;</p>
												<p>18.9.2 you will not be permitted to buy any further interests in Supported Cryptocurrencies or make or receive P2P Transfers; and</p>
												<p>18.9.3 you may – at our discretion – sell your interests in Supported Cryptocurrencies back to us.</p>
												<p>18.10 If at the end of the 14 day period you have not sold down all your interests in Supported Cryptocurrencies, you authorise us to buy back your interests at the best available price via the Cryptocurrency Exchange. The proceeds of such buy back will be credited to the e-money balance in your Skrill Account.</p>
												<p>18.11 For the avoidance of doubt, if your Skrill Account is terminated or suspended your access to the Cryptocurrency Services will also be terminated or suspended (as applicable).</p>
												<p><strong>19. Limitation of Liability</strong></p>
												<p>19.1 Nothing in these Cryptocurrency Services Terms of Use shall operate to exclude liability for death or personal injury due to negligence or for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation or for any statutory liability that cannot be excluded or amended according to applicable laws.</p>
												<p>19.2 Subject to section 19.1, we shall not be liable for:</p>

												<p>19.2.6 any losses arising from any act or failure to act by a Cryptocurrency Exchange or the provider of any Cryptocurrency Wallet; and</p>
												<p>19.2.7 any losses arising from incorrect instructions received by us from you.</p>
												<p><strong>20. Complaints</strong></p>
												<p>20.1 If you have a complaint in relation to the Cryptocurrency Services you should contact Customer Service. You should clearly indicate that you are wishing to make a complaint to us.

A copy of our complaints procedure is displayed on our Website.</p>
												<p>20.2 We endeavour to provide you with an answer or resolution to your complaint within 15 business days. Should this not be possible due to unforeseen circumstances or lack of information, we will contact you.</p>

												<p>21.2 We can change these Cryptocurrency Services Terms of Use for any of the following reasons (without limitation):</p>
												<p>21.2.1 because of a change in legal or regulatory requirements;</p>
												<p>21.2.2 if the change benefits you, for example when introducing new products or services or improving existing ones;</p>
												<p>21.2.3 to reflect a change in our costs of running the Cryptocurrency Services;</p>
												<p>21.2.4 where this is necessary due to market changes including any actions taken by a Cryptocurrency Exchange that might limit Skrill’s ability to fulfil an Order; or</p>
												<p>21.2.5 to respond to any other change that affects us, if it's fair to pass on the effects of the change to you, for example to reflect developments in the cryptocurrency market.</p>
												<p>21.3 We may also make changes for any other reason that we cannot foresee, for example to respond to changes in the cryptocurrency industry that affect how we wish to deliver the Cryptocurrency Services to you.</p>
												<p>21.4 The proposed change may come into effect immediately (if required by law/regulation or because of requirements imposed on us) or upon such later date as may be stated in the notice, unless you have given us notice that you object to the proposed change before the change comes into effect. Changes that are required by law or make these Cryptocurrency Services Terms of Use more favourable to you shall come into effect immediately if so stated in the change notice. Changes to currency exchange fees shall come into effect immediately without notice and you shall not have the right to object to such a change.</p>
