												<p>READ THESE PROGRAMME RULES CAREFULLY BEFORE PARTICIPATING.&nbsp; YOU WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE ACCEPTED THESE PROGRAMME RULES AND AGREED TO BE BOUND BY THEM WHEN PARTICIPATING IN THIS PROGRAMME. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THESE PROGRAMME RULES INCLUDE LIMITATIONS OF YOUR RIGHTS AND REMEDIES.</p>
												<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
												<p>1. These are the terms and conditions of the Skrill Knect Loyalty Programme (the “Programme” or “Loyalty Programme”) operated by Skrill Limited (“Skrill”), a company duly registered under the laws of England and Wales under company number 4260907, whose registered office is at 1st floor, 2 Gresham Street, London, EC2V 7AD, UK. Skrill is authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) under the Electronic Money Regulations 2011 for the issuing of electronic money. Our FCA registration number is 900001. Your participation in the Programme is subject to these terms and conditions ("Programme Rules").</p>
												<p>2. If you are a Qualifying Participant (as defined in Section 3 below), you are responsible for reading these Programme Rules to understand your rights, responsibilities and status in the Programme. If you are a Qualifying Participant, you will be asked to agree to the Programme Rules after you register for the Programme. Upon agreeing to the Programme Rules, you will be able to collect Skrill Loyalty Points (as defined in Section 6 below) and then redeem them for Rewards (as defined in Section 11 below) via the Programme website which you can access from your Skrill ‘My Account’ module. In addition to the Programme Rules, participation in the Programme and the use of Loyalty Points is subject to any requirements and procedures communicated by Skrill from time to time.</p>
												<p><strong>Please note the Skrill Loyalty Points are not electronic money, and you cannot use them to pay for goods and/or services with us or with other third parties. </strong></p>
												<p><strong>Participation in the Programme</strong></p>
												<p>3. To be a "Qualifying Participant" in the Programme and be able to earn Loyalty Points in accordance with Section 6.1. a-e you need to: a) be at least 18 years of age; b) be a current Skrill Account Holder of an active Skrill Account; c) be registered on&nbsp;<a href="../../../skrill-knect/index.html" target="_blank">the Programme Website</a>; d) not use your Skrill Account or participate in the Programme for commercial purposes; and е) not reside or be located in any country in which the use of a Skrill Account or participation in the Programme may violate any laws or regulations applicable to you. To be a "Qualifying Participant" in the Programme and be able to earn Loyalty Points in accordance with Section 6.1. (f) you need to also comply with the requirements in Table 1 hereof.</p>
												<p>4. Each Qualifying Participant shall be designated a unique identification number under the Programme.</p>
												<p>5. Skrill reserves the right to require participants to provide evidence demonstrating that they are Qualifying Participants and may at their discretion disqualify any participant if such evidence is not provided within a reasonable time stipulated by Skrill or if Skrill (acting reasonably) is not satisfied that the eligibility criteria are met. Use of script, macro or any automated system to enter the Programme is prohibited and entries made (or which appear to have been made) using any such system may be treated as void.&nbsp; Any illegible, incomplete or fraudulent entries may be rejected.</p>
												<p><strong>6. Earning Loyalty Points</strong></p>
												<p>6.1.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>A Qualifying Participant is entitled to loyalty points (“Points” or “Loyalty Points”) when making a Qualifying Transaction. A "Qualifying Transaction" is one of the following transactions using a Skrill Account: (a) an upload; (b) a withdrawal; (c) a purchase using a Skrill Prepaid Mastercard® (online or instore); (d)&nbsp;purchases and sells of interest in one or more Supported Cryptocurrencies (as defined in the&nbsp;<a href="../skrill-cryptocurrency-terms-of-use/indexcf25.html?uniqueLink=1" target="_blank">Skrill Cryptocurrency Terms of Use</a>); (e)&nbsp;transfer of your interest(s) in one or more Supported Cryptocurrencies to an Existing Customer(s) (as defined in the&nbsp;<a href="../skrill-cryptocurrency-terms-of-use/index7caf.html?uniqueLink=2" target="_blank">Skrill Cryptocurrency Terms of Use</a>); and (f) a transfer to a merchant (but only if you have used a payment method other than NETELLER or paysafecard to upload funds to your Skrill Account and have fulfilled the requirements in Table 1 hereof).&nbsp;Transfers to excluded merchants (“Excluded Merchants”) shall not be considered a Qualifying Transaction. Skrill reserves the right to modify the list of Excluded Merchants at any time upon its own discretion. A current list of Excluded Merchants is available in the “Transfer to merchant” section in the KNECT Module in Your Account. It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with the current list of Excluded Merchants.</p>
												<p>6.2. You can earn a maximum of one thousand (1,000) Points per Qualifying Transaction and an aggregate maximum of five hundred thousand (500, 000) Points in a calendar month. Any rounding will be done to the lower whole number (for example, if you transact an amount of up to EUR 0.5 you will get zero Points. If you transact an amount of EUR 1.1 – EUR 1.9 you will receive 1 Loyalty Point). Please refer to Table 1 for more information regarding how Loyalty Points are earned. Skrill reserves the right to grant Qualifying Participants extra Loyalty Points at its sole discretion.</p>
												<p>7. From time to time, and at the sole discretion of Skrill, you may be offered additional ways of earning Points via specific promotions. Participating in such promotions is subject to the designated rules specified for such promotion on the Programme website or in any other way communicated by Skrill.</p>
												<p>8. If you do not perform a Qualifying Transaction for a period of twelve (12) months or more, your Loyalty Programme account will be deactivated, and you will forfeit all of your earned Points. You can re-enroll in the Programme at any time after having your account deactivated, however all Loyalty Points that were earned prior to deactivation will be lost.</p>
												<p>9. Points do not constitute your property and have no cash equivalent value. Points earned by you are for your benefit only and may not be transferred to anyone and shall become void if transferred.</p>
												<p>10. Points earned and Rewards received through participation in the Programme may be subject to tax. Any tax liability, including disclosure, connected with the receipt or use of Points or Rewards is your responsibility.</p>
												<p><strong>Redeeming Loyalty Points</strong></p>
												<p>11. You may redeem Points at your Skrill Account’s ‘Rewards’ Section for such rewards as we may make available from time to time (“Rewards”), including: (a) electronic money that will be issued to your Skrill Account;&nbsp;and (b) such products, gift cards and merchant vouchers (“Items”) , as we may make available within the Rewards catalogue (the “Catalogue”). The selection of Items is subject to availability in the Catalogue and the number of points needed to redeem for them may change at any time. Use of Items is subject to the rules of third parties (vendors) that may be accessed online. It is your sole responsibility to read and comply with such third parties’ rules. Each Item’s vendor has the right to place restrictions on the use of its Item(s). Items are not exchangeable, refundable, transferable or redeemable for cash, cannot be replaced if lost or stolen and are void where prohibited. Items must be presented to the respective vendor for redemption, use, and the delivery of goods and services. Skrill shall have no obligations and/or liability concerning the delivery, quality and/or fitness for a particular purpose of the respective Item(s). Items may be subject to taxes as provided by the applicable law of the jurisdiction in which the purchase is made. Taxes, if applicable, may be a charge against the value of the Item or may require a separate supplemental payment by the respective Item’s vendor. Skrill has no obligations and/or liability towards you for any returns, refunds and claims related to the Items.</p>
												<p>12. All of the Points earned in any calendar year must be redeemed by the end of the following calendar year or all of the Points earned in that year will expire at the end of the said following calendar year. The ability to track Points online via the Programme website will be made available and periodically updated at Skrill’s sole discretion. It is your responsibility to track and, if desired, redeem the Points prior to the expiration of the respective calendar year.</p>
												<p><strong>13. Changes to the Programme and Termination</strong></p>
												<p>13.1 Skrill may, among other things: (a) increase or decrease the number of Points awarded for a Qualifying Transaction or required for a Reward; (b) increase or decrease the maximum number of Points that each Qualifying Participant can earn; (c) withdraw, limit, modify, or cancel any Reward; (d) restrict the continued availability of Rewards; (e) change Programme benefits, Rewards, conditions of participation, rules for earning, redeeming, retaining, or forfeiting Points; (f) change or cancel Rewards; or change the list of Excluded Merchants in its sole discretion at any point of time without prior notification. Save as expressly provided for to the contrary in this Section 13.1, the proposed change shall come into effect thirty (30) days after the date the change notice is deemed received under Section 13.2, unless you have given us notice that you object to the proposed changes before the changes come into effect.
